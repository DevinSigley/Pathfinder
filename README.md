# Pathfinder
Given dimensions, generates a maze (up to 50x50) and solves it, both into a .ps file. Completed as a class project. The file "output.cc" and the function prototypes in "pathfinder.h" were provided by my instructor. 
Memory-efficiency was suggested, so data is encoded bitwise to save space.

An example of a completed maze generated by this program can be found in Pathfinder/maze.pdf

Here's an image of a completed maze with checked routes marked in red and the solution marked in blue:
